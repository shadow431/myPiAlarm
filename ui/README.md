UI

This folder contains the starts of a UI for an alarm pannel.  Right now it has 4 screens:

Main

This screen gives you access to functions. Alarm, Lighting, Audion, Windows, Video, etc. (right now only has alarm)

Zones

This screen gives you access to configured alarm zones.  They are green if disarmed, red if armed.

Pin

This screen gives you a key pad to arm/disarm the alarm.


It also conatains a Photo frame time out.  If you let it sit untouched it will begin to cycle through images. Right now it uses a static folder, soon it will be able to grab from a web site, stay tuned. It will be cool.
